# Reroute

Reroute is a Chrome extension for redirecting all connections to a route to
another, useful for pointing production endpoints to their development
alternatives.

## Installation

* Clone this Git repository to your local machine.

* Open the Extension Management page by navigating to `chrome://extensions`.

  The Extension Management page can also be opened by clicking on the Chrome
  menu, hovering over `More Tools` then selecting `Extensions`.

* Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to `Developer mode`.

* Click the `LOAD UNPACKED` button and select the extension directory.

  The extension directory is located at `/path/to/repository/src`. You must
  navigate to the `src` directory and not just the reposotiry directory.
